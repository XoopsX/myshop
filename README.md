Create stores with shopping cart and custom storefront design, dashboard, catalog (pdf), newsletter, order, stock and discount management, plugins and gateways. Myshop lets you securely deliver paid digital product downloads on your website using custom payment gateways. Payment gateways are “methods” of accepting payments for purchases through Myshop. By default, Myshop comes with the payment gateway PayPal. Due to the extensible nature of Myshop plugin, add-on payment gateways can be easily created.
